# Auto-Regressive Atmospheric Modeling

ARAM is a python-based package that simulates turbulent atmospheric emission using a auto-regressive gaussian process framework, for applications in observational astronomy. 

## Background and Methodology

Atmospheric modeling is an important step in both experiment design and subsequent data analysis for ground-based cosmological telescopes observing the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The next generation of CMB experiments will be marked by a huge increase in data acquisition.

By default, atmospheric emission simulated by ARAM is designed to resemble that observed by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Atacama B-Mode Search (ABS), two CMB experiments in the Atacama Desert. An outline of the method and products used is outlined [here](https://github.com/tomachito/aram/blob/main/README.md). 


## Examples and Usage 

Below: a theoretical array of 40,000 detectors scans across a simulated map of the cosmic microwave background. Each detector has a resolution of an arcminute.
